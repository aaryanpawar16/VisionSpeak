The ability to access textual information is essential for daily activities, yet visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in interacting with printed or handwritten text. Despite advancements in assistive technologies, existing solutions often lack real-time processing, portability, or affordability, making them less practical for widespread adoption. This project, "Image to Audio Conversion for Visually Impaired," aims to bridge this accessibility gap by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to provide a seamless text-to-audio conversion system.
The proposed system captures images containing textual content, extracts the text using advanced OCR algorithms, and processes it into clear, intelligible speech output. It is designed to work efficiently across various formats, including printed books, handwritten notes, and digital displays. The system incorporates natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve text interpretation, ensuring accurate pronunciation and contextual understanding. Additionally, it will integrate deep learning-based OCR for enhanced recognition of complex fonts and handwritten scripts.
Portability and affordability are key considerations in the design of this solution. The system can be implemented as a mobile application, embedded hardware device, or wearable technology like smart glasses, making it versatile and accessible. Real-time processing ensures immediate feedback, enabling visually impaired users to interact with text-based content effortlessly and independently.
By providing an intuitive and cost-effective assistive tool, this project empowers visually impaired individuals, fostering greater independence and inclusion in education, employment, and daily life. Future enhancements may include multilingual support, AI-driven voice modulation, and integration with Braille displays to further enhance usability. This innovation underscores the potential of AI and computer vision in creating a more inclusive society for individuals with disabilities.
